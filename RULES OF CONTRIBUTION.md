## General Rules
- Do not upload files in any way; only use links to them. Issues containing files will be removed without further attention.
- Do not open issues for elements that don't match the provided categories. (See below.)
- When you find an element that may match a category, check whether your AdBlocker includes a list that blocks this element (Enable Annoyances, Cookies, Social Widgets Lists).
- Provide as much detail as possible, this will make work easier.
- Avoid opening duplicate issues.
- Be cautious when contributing cookie elements. If your adblocker blocks certain annoyances and you still see them, they are often necessary for the website to function.

## Catergory Definitions
**Blank Elements/Spaces/Annoyances:** 
These are empty HTML elements or whitespace that do not contribute to the content or functionality of a webpage. They often include unnecessary tags that may affect page layout or loading speed without providing value.

**Promotional Elements:**
Promotional elements are components on a webpage that encourage user actions, such as signing up for newsletters, subscribing to services, or creating accounts for third party services. This category includes pop-ups, banners, and other prompts that may disrupt the user experience but are NOT traditional ads.

**Cookie Notices:**
Cookie notices are notifications that inform users about the use of cookies on a website, typically for tracking or personalization purposes. These notices often appear as banners or pop-ups, requiring user consent and can sometimes be intrusive or repetitive.

**Tracking Parameters:**
These are URL query strings used to monitor user behavior across websites. They typically appear after the ? in a URL and can reveal:

- Source tracking (where you came from)
- Click/engagement data
- Device/browser fingerprints

Example:
https://example.com/product?utm_source=facebook&affiliate_id=12345
â†’ utm_source and affiliate_id are tracking parameters.

IMPORTANT: USING SUCH A FILTER WILL BREAK AFFILIATE LINKS. If you still want to support merchants don't use this filter.
